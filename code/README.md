## Overview 

The purpose of this code is to study the impact of future fossil fuel prices on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in the process of energy transition. By predicting fossil fuel prices in different scenarios and combining WACC calculation and analysis, the code provides a comprehensive approach to explore the relationship between market sentiment, historical data, and future capital costs in the energy economy. Specific tasks include: processing WACC and historical fossil fuel price , predicting future fossil fuel prices using LSTM and GRP model, building a  Stacking Regressor analysis to evaluate the impact.
