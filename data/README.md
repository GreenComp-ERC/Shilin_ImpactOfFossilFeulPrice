# Data

## The source and purpose of the datase
The data used for this analysis comes from two primary sources: the WACC data from Calcaterra et al. (2024) and historical fossi fuel(oil,coal, natural gas) price from the dataset of World Bank.

The purpose of using the historical price dataset is to predict the trend of fossil fuel price prices from 2025 to 2100. Specifically, it will be used as the input to the [LSTM and GRP modle](https://github.com/GreenComp-ERC/Shilin_ImpactOfFossilFeulPrice/tree/main/code). Then, these predicted results will be integrated with the WACC (weighted average cost of capital) forecast results in Calcaterra et al. (2024), which represent the economic conditions under different energy transition scenarios.

The main goal of this analysis is to explore the impact of fossil fuel price fluctuations on future WACC of energy transition projects. By comparing the predicted prices with the estimated WACC results, we can analyze the potential impact of fossil fuel price fluctuations on capital costs, which is a key factor in energy infrastructure investment decision-making. This analysis will provide important insights to help us understand how oil price fluctuations affect the formulation of future energy transition strategies and changes in the financing environment.
